# Project Stats
An easy way to display useless info about your coding project.

### About
Project Stats does, as the name indicates, display statistics about your project. As of right now it shows you what
programming languages are used, but maybe there will be more in the future!

### Usage
Build the project using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) and run the binary file.\
**Important:** you need to append a directory path as a program argument. This will be the location which will get scanned.\
Like that: ```.\project_stats.exe .\my_project\```
